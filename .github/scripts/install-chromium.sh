#
#   bash .github/scripts/install-chromium.sh pnpm --filter @statewalker/cellb-site exec playwright
#
# `playwright install --with-deps` also installs Chromium's system libraries with apt. When the
# runner cannot reach the Ubuntu mirrors ("Temporary failure resolving 'archive.ubuntu.com'"), that
# step fails after minutes of apt retries and the whole job goes red before any test runs. GitHub's
# Ubuntu images already ship Chrome and the libraries it needs, so then Chromium is installed
# without them, with a warning: the tests show whether anything is missing.
