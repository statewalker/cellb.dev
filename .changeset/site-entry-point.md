"@statewalker/cellb": minor
---

`createProjectSite` moves to its own entry point, `@statewalker/cellb/site`, and `@statewalker/cellb/browser` no longer exports it. Its compiler, `@statewalker/webrun-modules` (with lightningcss-wasm and @jspm/core), `@statewalker/webrun-site-builder` and `@statewalker/webrun-site-host` become optional peer dependencies. A plain install goes from 52 MB to 19 MB on disk (41 MB to 12 MB of files), and an app that imports only `@statewalker/cellb/browser` no longer ships lightningcss-wasm's 16 MB `.wasm`.

Migration, for projects that build a site in the browser: install the three peers and import `createProjectSite` from `@statewalker/cellb/site` instead of `@statewalker/cellb/browser`.
